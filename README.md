What is PACT?
-------------

PACT is a plug-in for EEGLAB. PACT stands for (cross-frequency)
Phase-Amplitude Coupling Toolbox. See the github repository at
[<https://github.com/sccn/PACT>](https://github.com/sccn/PACT) to submit
bug reports or modify the codebase.

What data does PACT take?
-------------------------

Currently it takes continuous data only. PACT was originally developed
for electrocorticographic (ECoG) data analysis.

What does PACT do?
------------------

In preparatory exploration, you may run a brute-force computation of PAC
for all combinations of low-frequency oscillation (LFO) and
highest-amplitude sampling (HAS) center frequencies. This computation
may take a long time depending on the frequency resolution and bandwidth
you specify. To compute each PAC value for a channel
frequency-by-frequency combination, PACT performs the following steps:

1\. Band-pass filter the data to extract HFO and LFO signals.

2\. Hilbert transform the HFO signal to extract a time series of
instantaneous amplitudes.

3\. Hilbert transform the LFO signal to extract a time series of
instantaneous phases.

4\. (Highest-Amplitude Sampling, HAS): apply a threshold to select the
N% highest HFO amplitudes. Obtain the HAS index from this.

5\. For LFO phase, apply HAS index.

6\. Combine HAS-indexed HFO and LFO indices into complex-valued phasors.

7\. Compute the Modulation Index (Canotly et al., 2006) for the
collection of HAS phasors constructed above.

8\. Generate a collection of surrogate data by circularly permuting the
phase time-series relative to the amplitude series.

9\. Compute a surrogate set of Modulation Indices for which the null
hypothesis should hold and determine a statistical threshold from their
distribution.

10\. Perform multiple comparison corrections based on the number of
channels for which you are estimating PAC significance.

Note: To compute and perform statistics on the Mean Resultant Vector
Length, PACT uses CircStat (Berens, 2009). To compute phase-sorted
amplitude statistics, PACT uses K-S and Chi-square tests.

What do the PACT GUIs look like?
--------------------------------

When successfully installed, the item
'PACT' should appear under 'Tools' (Figure 1). Currently it has 12
menus.

-   Compute PAC: This launches the main GUI (Figure 2). When press ok,
    computation starts. When it done, statistics set up window pops up
    (described later).

    -   Amp freq range \[lohz hihz\]
    -   Highest amplitude sampling rate \[%\]
    -   Sampling pool: This is for the experimental purpose. Always
        choose 'Each channel'.
    -   If handpicked, event type and win size \[+/- ms\]: If you want
        to run the analysis using the data around event markers
        generated by either VidEd or MoBILAB, use this.
    -   Significance threshold \[p\]
    -   Number of surrogation \[N\]: This determines how many data
        points you want to generate surrogate data that represents for
        distribution of null hypothesis.
    -   Number of phase bins \[N\]: This affects sensitivity of circular
        statistics. Don't use too extremely large value (e.g. \>100).

What plots does PACT output?
----------------------------

1\. LFO-HAS parameter space scan results (combination of LFO phase
frequencies and HAS rates; the measure used may be either Mean Resultant
Vector Length or Modulation Index.

2\. Using Modulation Index with a confidence interval of 95% or 99%.

3a. Angular histogram displayed in a polar plot using Mean Resultant
Vector Length.

3b. Angular histogram in a rectangular plot with phase unwrapped on the
x-axis.

4\. Bar graphs of LFO phase-sorted HFO-amplitudes.

Note that the number of phase bins in Figures 3a and 3b is determined by
user input and affects the results of the circular statistics.

How PACT can be used, and how its output can be interpreted: A demo example
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

These plots show examples in which PACT was applied to
electrocorticographic data for which a neurologist judged the channel(
Ch) 1 signal to be pathological and the Ch2 signal to be normal.

First, exploratory LFO frequency scans were performed (Figures 7 and 8,
top left; they are the same). We needed to run PACT several times,
adjusting parameters; the result that showed the difference most clearly
is plotted here. Mean Resultant Vector Length was chosen as the
dependent variable, since it is naturally normalized from 0 to 1 and is
therefore convenient for comparisons across channels. This plot shows
two noticeable clusters of interest that showed differences between Ch1
and Ch2:.One is (LFO 0.5 Hz, HAS 3%,) the other (LFO 1.5 Hz, HAS 1.5%).
We decided to run analysis for both combinations of parameters.
Statistical significance level was set to 1% with Bonferroni-Holm
correction (Note: here, since we have only 2 items to compare, B-H is
the same as Bonferroni).

<i><p style="text-align: center">Figure 7. LFO 0.5Hz, HAS 3%, p < 0.01, CI 95%. Top left, LFO-HAS parameter space scan results. Top right, Modulation Index. Bottom left, Mean Resultant Vector Length. Bottom right, phase-sorted HFO amplitudes</p></i> 

Figure 7 shows the result of choosing parameters (LFO0.5 Hz, HAS 3%). The Modulation Index
for Ch1 is larger than that for Ch2. Only the Ch1 value reached
statistical significance (Figure 7, top right; a horizontal bar in the
graph shows the 95% confidence interval). By Mean Resultant Vector
length, both channel signals exhibited showed phase concentrations,
though their preferred phases were different -- almost opposite (Figure
7, bottom left). Phase-sorted HFO amplitude also indicated that Ch1 has
a preferred phase, and the Ch1 amplitude distribution over phase bins
deviates significantly from uniform, whereas Ch2 does not show this
effect (Figure 7, bottom right). Note also the large difference in
amplitude scales.

![](PACT15Hz.jpg) <i><p style="text-align: center">Figure 8. LFO 1.5Hz, HAS 1.5%, p < 0.01, CI 95%. Top right, Modulation Index. Bottom left, Mean Resultant Vector Length. Bottom right, Phase-sorted HFO amplitude. Note that the Ch1 Modulation Index is much larger than the confidence interval compared to Figure 7</p></i> 

Figure 8 shows the result of
choosing the parameters (LFO 1.5 Hz, HAS 1.5%). Modulation Index, Mean
Resultant Vector length, and Phase-sorted HFO amplitude all showed
similar properties to the results shown in Figure 7. However, note that
the Ch1 Modulation Index is much larger than its confidence interval
level; probably this combination of parameters better fits the
pathological pattern in this channel signal.

Caution and Limitation
----------------------

The 'Handpick HFO' menu does not work with newer Matlab versions, which
no longer support the *graphics.cursorbar* object. To use this function,
use Matlab 2013 or older as a workaround.

Scanning Phase-frequency vs. HFO-frequency (07/24/2019 updated)
---------------------------------------------------------------

In calculating phase-amplitude coupling, a typical problem is how to
determine the target frequencies in both phase and amplitude. To perform
it simply, in ver.0.30 I implemented a function to generate
phase-amplitude frequency-by-frequency grid plot. If you need to reduce
the number of channel, do so by using EEGLAB GUI beforehand. Otherwise,
this frequency scan process does not need any preprocessing by PACT, it
does the job itself. One extra parameter you have to choose is highest
amplitude sampling (HAS) rate, which specifies the right-tail cutoff for
the amplitude distribution for each channel. Note that this is only
picking up the highest amplitude after high-frequency band-pass filter,
so if there is artifact with high-frequency (or broadband), HAS will
pick it up. In this case, you would want to clean the data using EEGLAB
function before performing this analysis.

In the example below, one can easily find that Ch21 showed the strongest
PAC between 3-Hz phase and 80-Hz HFO amplitude, followed by Ch16. Ch18
also showed some PAC, but it coupled with 1.7 Hz instead of 3 Hz so this
could be something different. If one chooses mean vector length to show
instead of Canolty's modulation index (MI), it allows to evaluate the
same measure without the effect of HFO amplitude. The calculated values
are stored under EEG.pacScan.

### How to obtain mean HFO gamma amplitude

1.  In the plot above, confirm that the peak PAC value is observed at
    Ch21, phase 3.2-Hz, ampltiude 80-Hz.
2.  Type 'EEG.pacScan' in the command line. Among the variables, find
    'meanHfoAmp' This is mean HFO amplitude in microVolt. If you are not
    sure about dimensions, see 'dataDimensions'. We know our channel and
    freq-freq window of interest, which are 21, 3.2 Hz, 80 Hz,
    respectively. Based on these parameters of interest, we obtain
    indices for these parameters: 21 for the channel order, 7 for the
    phase freq (see 'phaseFreqEdge'--3.2Hz is between the 7th and 8th
    edges, so we select 7), and 1 for the HFO freq.
3.  We enter EEG.pacScan.meanHfoAmp(21,7,1) in the command window. It
    returned '35.0391' which mean the mean HFO amplitude during the
    selected HFO frames was 35.0391 microVolt.
